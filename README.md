# ❤️ Love Stickers for WhatsApp (Valentine's Day Pack)

## Project Overview

This Android application was developed to provide a curated collection of romantic and Valentine's Day-themed sticker packs for WhatsApp users. Beyond software development, this project served as a **real-world case study in mobile app publishing and digital marketing**.

* **Data Analysis:** Monitored Cost Per Install (CPI) and conversion rates to optimize ad spend.
* **Analytics:** Tracked user growth and retention via Google Play Console.

## Performance Highlights

* **100+ Downloads:** Achieved over 100 active installs shortly after launch through a mix of organic search and paid campaigns.
